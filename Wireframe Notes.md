A sketch is used to just get you bearings on what you want and get an idea of a user’s flow. A medium fidelity wireframe is used to generate a lot of different ideas to see what sticks and what doesn’t. This is almost like a brainstorming session. A high-fidelity wire frame is fine turned to what the actual product should look like. This will take into account many different aspects like UX and company branding. 

The process I took to create this diagram was to make a site that I liked. My official title at work is web developer but I’m more of a web designer with not training and I wanted to just make something that I liked and that didn’t have to be taken so seriously. I’ve made and see so many of the same website that I just wanted to make something a little bit different and something that broke the rules in a fun way. After all this site would be mean for other college students. I made these pages since they are the first things a new user with see. The other pages also need me to work out for features to see how I’m going to display them. I’ll probably go back and make some final changes for readability’s sake since at the end of the day that takes priority .
