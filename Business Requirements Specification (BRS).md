# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Business purpose

The business purpose to pursue this new system would be to spearhead professional development within our employee. In creating this system, she would have learned a great deal of new skills and would also be able to pad her resume for this. This is inline with the business purpose of being employed after graduation.

## 1.2 Business scope

The Business domain would be productivity software. We aim at making reading easier for the average student buy keeping focus and making notetaking accessible everywhere.

## 1.3 Business overview

## 1.5 Major stakeholders

Major stakeholders would be the users once the first version of the product is released. There will be no investors or the such, not buy our choosing. The users will have heavy hand in guiding development and new features. The customers will have a little more weight their feedback since they pay for this service.

# 3 Business management requirements

## 3.1 Business environment

External environments that could affect this system would include the preferred choice of operating system used by our target demographic, students. At the moment is it easy to elicit stakeholder requirements since our developer is currently enrolled in university surrounded by our target demographic. However as time goes on she will graduate and t will become harder to gather those requirements. 

## 3.2 Mission, goals, and objectives

Our mission is to make studying and independent learning easier to accomplish. A student should not dread to sit down and study especially if they are using our product.

## 3.3 Business model

The business model will be tier-based subscriptions while still including a non-stifling free version. The high tiers would have more features to make it worth the investment.

## 3.4 Information environment

This will be our sole project for this business, so we don’t have to consider any other system.

## 4 Business operational requirements

## 4.1 Business processes

The system supports the business activates by creating a product to sell. 

## 4.2 Business operational policies and rules

The system will target college students followed by high school students. We run the possibility of containing sensitive information on our users so we must have polices on security and encryption. There are not many constraints as we don’t have existing systems to integrate with. But we do have to be mindful of the budget so the system must be build as cheaply as possible using as much free student software as we can.

## 4.3 Business operational constraints

The system will be built using the smallest budget available. We will optimize for faster development speeds buy using languages and software that the developer is familiar with to help alleviate the time constraint.  

## 4.4 Business operational modes

During Hurricane operation mode our developer will focus on drinking water and making the most of it since she will not be able to work while the internet in down.

## 4.5 Business operational quality

The system will have unit testing to ensure quality and functionality as time goes on. Quality will be a priority over urgency through out the project. 

## 4.6 Business structure

The business with have one department, development.  It will be responsible for everything and accountable for nothing.

# 5 Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept

The system will be a note taking app to help with readings. It’s primary goal is to make a text to speech to help students focus. It will allow users to upload their text to the system and have it dynamic subtitles to keep their eyes on the screen. In addition to this feature the user will be able to annotate the text by highlighting and adding notes “in the margin” next to the text. 

## 5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios

A user will log in their their account navigate to create a new reading. Upload their text and select their preferred reading speed. through out the reading they are able to pause and highlight the text, add notes and additional thoughts, and rewind if they need to. After they are done the user can simply exist the page and have their notes saved.

## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept

For this stage we are able to talk to our developers peers and see what their needs are as students. Sending out a form for them to fill out interview students who could be power users. Students who have a lot of reading in there major.

## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept

We will deploy when we made a minimum viable product to maximize the amount of feedback we can get back and start creating a useful product as close to the start as possible.

## 6.3 Preliminary support concept

There is not a lot of manpower to spare for support. If a release is breaking the system then it will be full steam ahead on fixing it. If it’s not a catastrophic failure then it might not be worth our time to fix it until their enough issues to release a fix update.

## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept

after to many years without an update the system will be deleted so it’s not a security threat to our users data.

# 7 Project Constraints

The main project constraints are time and money. The development team is one college student.
